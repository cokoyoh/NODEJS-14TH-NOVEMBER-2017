Son we live in a world that is surrounded by walls and those whals need protecting.
Who's gonna protect them? You? You Lieutenat Wieldburg? You weep for Santiago and you curse the Marines. 

You have that luxury. I don't have that luxury. I have a greater responsibility than you can posibly fathom.

Deep down in places you don't talk about at parties, you need me on that wall, you want me on that wall. So I suggest you pick up a weapon and stand apost. either way, I don't give a damn what you think you are entitles to.
